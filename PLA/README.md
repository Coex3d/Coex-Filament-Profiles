# PLA

[Coex 3D PLA](https://coex3d.com/collections/pla) is a perfect material for prototypes, aesthetic parts, and rigid light-duty functional parts. Our PLA is made from only 100% virgin resin and colorant, with no fillers! All 1.75mm diameter Coex 3D are specified to Â±0.03mm.

# PLA Printing Tips

- Our recommended printing temperature may seem higher than other PLA brands. This is because we use 100% virgin resin, which raises the melting point of the filament slightly.
- Ensure you use sufficient part cooling to avoid printing a new layer on top of a layer that hasn't fully cooled.
- A heated bed is optional when printing PLA, but it will significantly improve bed adhesion.
- PLA can be post-processed by sanding but care must be taken to not overheat the material when sanding it. PLA *cannot* be post-processed using solvents.
